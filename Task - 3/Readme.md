# Iris Dataset Classification ðŸŒ¸

This repository contains a project to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks and consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Overview ðŸªŸ
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which includes:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

## Installation
To run this project locally, please ensure you have the following packages installed:

## Model Training
The model is trained using a Decision Tree Classifier. The steps include:

-Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
-Training the classifier with the training set.
-Evaluating the model on the testing set.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure the model generalizes well.


## Feature Importance
Feature importance is analyzed to understand which features contribute the most to the model's decisions. The importance of each feature is visualized using a bar plot.
