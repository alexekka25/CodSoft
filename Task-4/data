# Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project involves predicting the amount of sales based on advertising expenditures across various platforms such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper. The goal is to create a machine learning model using Python to forecast future sales, enabling businesses to optimize their advertising strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `advertising.csv`, which includes the following columns:
- `TV`: Advertising spend on TV.
- `Radio`: Advertising spend on Radio.
- `Newspaper`: Advertising spend on Newspapers.
- `Sales`: The target variable representing sales.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
- Load the dataset using pandas.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and check for missing values.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Visualize the distributions of features and the target variable.
- Analyze the relationships between features and the target variable using pairplots and correlation matrices.

### 3. Data Preparation
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20 split).

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Select and train a Linear Regression model using the training data.
- Evaluate the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.

### 5. Model Interpretation and Analysis
- Interpret the model coefficients to understand feature importance.
- Visualize the predictions versus actual values and analyze residuals.

### 6. Detailed Model Evaluation
- Provide detailed evaluation metrics for the regression model.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, joblib
